You should be able to look at a problem from the user's perspective, discuss abstract concepts with fellow developers, as well as produce an elegant implementation. Developers we have hired in the past mostly hold an exceptional master's degree in computer science or even a doctorate.\nAt think-cell, we like flat hierarchies. You will work largely independently and will be responsible for the whole range of activities when implementing a new feature. We expect each of our developers to do architecture, design, implementation and bug fixing, rather than splitting these activities between several people. We thus minimize communication losses and put everyone in control of their own work. Your ideas are welcome, even if they mean that we have to change a lot of code to make things better.\nWe have published several scientific articles in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics and we will encourage you to do the same. We sponsor visits to conferences and have close connections to universities and research institutes in the U.S. and Germany.\nthink-cell encourages a healthy work-life balance. We do not work at night or on weekends, and support our staff's families with a full-time company nanny. She is available for free when children are sick, or if you just feel like spending an evening out.\nWe pay very competitive salaries, and offer our developers EUR 130,000 annually following one year of employment. If necessary, we will go out of our way to help you relocate to Berlin, and will do what we can to help you acquire a work permit.\nRemote work is now also possible!\nAbout our softwareSince 2002, think-cell produces graphics software that performs most of the painstaking work of creating data-driven slides for professional Excel and PowerPoint users. PowerPoint slide creation is one of the most popular things professionals use a computer for. Thus, it is rather surprising that while intelligent software has revolutionized many things we frequently do, such as web search in our browser, or telephone speech recognition in a call center, office productivity software has not changed much over the past decade or so.\nthink-cell is out to change this. We stand out from the crowd of other presentation software because we are willing to do the leg work of developing sophisticated algorithms and refining our user interface, which makes working with our software so satisfying for our users. Here are some highlights of what we have done.\nAlgorithmic highlightsWe developed a new algorithm for automatic point cloud labeling that allows labels to be positioned away from the actual points.We developed a new algorithm for automatic column chart labeling.We are working with John Forrest \u2013 author of the linear solver CLP \u2013 to make his simplex code faster on our kind of problems.We developed quite a few generic data structures that are not in C++ or Boost, for example partitions.\nHacking highlightsTo do things that are not possible via the documented Microsoft Office API, we do lots of reverse engineering with the disassembler IDA from Hex-Rays.We wrote probably the best function hooking engine out there. On each start of our software, we patch the Microsoft Office executables in memory. We search for small chunks of assembly code rather than hard-coding patch addresses to be robust against minor code modifications.We redirect PowerPoint's and Excel's window contents into offscreen buffers and use Direct3D 9.0 to render our user interface on top.\nOther highlightsWe fund the working group for programming languages of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). Some of our employees are members of this committee and vote in the international standardization process of ISO/IEC C++.We closely track the latest versions of our compilers, Visual C++ and Xcode, so we can always use the latest C++ standard features as soon as they become available.We use Boost throughout our code, e.g., Boost.Spirit for most of our parsing needs.We have our own range library, in the same spirit as Boost.Range or Eric Niebler\u2019s range-v3, but going further, for example, by unifying internal and external iteration. We gave a talk about it, and most of the code is public.We have our own reference-counting and persistence libraries to save and restore whole object trees.We wrote a parser and writer for the Excel .xls format.We have an extensive bug reporting infrastructure. Assertions and error checks stay in the release code, and our software automatically reports bugs to our server. The server analyzes the bug, categorizes it and files it in a database that all developers can access. If an update fixes the bug, the user can download the update directly from a bug response web page.\nInterested?If you are the one missing from our team then please send us your electronic application via hr@think-cell.com\n We will only accept applications that contain a CV."}, {"position": "Security Software Engineer Intern 2023", "job_id": "3324380591", "company": "Affirm", "date": "1 week ago", "type": "Internship \u00b7 Mid-Senior level", "description": "Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

Only well-designed and well-documented code is easy to reuse or modify for new applications by other developers (developer-friendly); significant effort is required to bring research-based code to this level. Similarly hard is the design of intuitive user interfaces that allow scientists without expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms to use the software (user-friendly). Additional sustained long-term effort is often required to maintain the code over its lifetime and provide user support.\nWe recently created the Open Science Software Initiative (OSSI) (https://www.janelia.org/open-science/overview/open-science-software-initiative-ossi/) that is focused on working closely with labs and teams at HHMI Janelia to create impactful open-source software for the broader research community.\nWe are looking for a talented and motivated Scientific Computing Associate (SCA) (https://www.janelia.org/support-team/scientific-computing-software/scientific-computing-associates) who is enthusiastic about open-source software development and would like to work on one or more of these exciting, machine learning centric projects:CellPose and Suite2p (with Stringer lab)Open-source platform for single-molecule localization (with Turaga lab)Kilosort (with Pachitariu lab)Usable, extensible video annotation library for machine learning (with Branson lab)Paintera (with Saalfeld lab)\nDetailed information on these projects can be found on the OSSI webpage (https://www.janelia.org/open-science/overview/open-science-software-initiative-ossi/ossi-supported-projects)\nThe SCA position represents an alternative to the traditional postdoc and provides an ideal environment to establish a career in computational research or software engineering. The position aims at developing qualifications and experience in computational research and professional software engineering in a research environment that enables the candidate to pursue her/his/their future career in science or industry. For each project, the SCA will be paired with an experienced software engineer and a member from the specific lab, often the lab head, in order to quickly learn techniques and about the project itself.The developed software will of course be openly accessible and the SCA has the opportunity to become (one of) the major contributing developers over time and to publish the results.The SCA position is a time-limited appointment for 12 to 24 months, with discretionary renewal for a final 12-month term (maximally 36 months in total).\nQualifications:M.S. or PhD in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Engineering, or ScienceExperience with writing efficient code in PythonExperience with deep learning frameworks PyTorch and/or TensorFlowIdeally experience with large data and distribution frameworks (e.g. Dask, Spark)Ideally experience in UI programming (e.g. Napari, PyQT, web-based UIs)\nWhat we do for you:Provide and include you in an environment of open-source enthusiastsSkilled scientists and software engineers support the projectEnable you to work as an independent scientistProvide an exciting and inspiring work environment at HHMI JaneliaProvide competitive compensation\nIf you are excited about a specific open-source project that you may even have contributed to please include this in your application, so we can discuss code together.
